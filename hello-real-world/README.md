## Plan Bs and PhDs: Thinking About Alternative Non-Academic Careers

A reveal.js presentation given on October 12, 2016 to some PhDs at Vanderbilt University's history department.

### How did I come up with this advice?
This advice comes both from my own experience and from other PhDs who've found work outside the academy. It also incorporates a great discussion from the
Texas Applied Anthropology Summit, and conversations with many patient folks in tech who I pestered to tell me what they really thought about hiring liberal arts grads.
Though some of the advice is specific to people with post-graduate degrees, much of it is true for anyone who wants to think about how their humanities degree translates
into a modern job search.

###Exectutive Summary/TL;DR
1) Don't throw resumes into the void. Choose target industries, then companies, and proceed accordingly.
2) NETWORK. What gets you a job will be a person, not a resume. Local meetups and webinars rock.
3) If you're trying to do this and have an academic life, put it on your calendar: a meetup every month, your resume every week.
4) The path won't be linear; accept the serendipity and make your own luck.
5) Be kind to yourself and grateful to those who help you.
