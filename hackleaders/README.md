# Put a Thing Online Presentation

A reveal.js presentation put together for the [American Society of News Editors](http://asne.org/) ["Hack Leadership" conference](http://asne.org/blog_home.asp?Display=1695). In an hour and a half, we used github pages to publish a really simple HTML flie. 

I'd like to iterate on this presentation, because I've come to belive that it's not enough to teach people HTML and send them on their way; it's the act of publishing/deploying that is truly powerful.
